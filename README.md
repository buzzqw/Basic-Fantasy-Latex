This is my omage to [Basic Fantasy](https://www.basicfantasy.org/downloads.html) 

Since i am utterly unable to edit the [FREE manual](https://www.basicfantasy.org/downloads.html) with Libreoffice i ported it to Latex!

The version of manual is 132.

For compiling the PDF you need Basic-Fantasy-RPG-Rules-r132.odt and unzip it. Move the Pictures folder to the same folder with BF.tex and rename Pictures folder to "Pictures132".

My PDF while verbatim on text about original manual may have some difference in layout mostly due to different compiling and layout structuring by latex.

Soutane fonts freely avaiable from fontsgeek.com

For compiling you need an updated Latex version using xelatex, or you can use the [tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/) engine for a simplier approach.
